To-Do App (TypeScript)
A simple and interactive To-Do application built with TypeScript, showcasing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as Inheritance and Polymorphism. This application demonstrates the power of TypeScript in managing multiple classes and interactions in a clean and maintainable way.

Features
Add new tasks to your to-do list.
Mark tasks as completed or delete them.
Edit existing tasks.
View tasks in a dynamic list format.
User interaction with multiple classes and OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism.
Technologies Used
TypeScript: Provides type safety and better code structure.
CSS: Styling of the application interface.
HTML: Basic structure of the app.
JavaScript: For handling app logic and interaction.
EJS: Templating engine for rendering dynamic content.
OOP Principles Implemented
Inheritance: Common task features are inherited by specific task types (e.g., general tasks, priority tasks).
Polymorphism: The app uses polymorphism to handle different types of tasks dynamically based on their properties.

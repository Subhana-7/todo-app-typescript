# To-Do App (TypeScript)

A simple and interactive To-Do application built with TypeScript, showcasing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as **Inheritance** and **Polymorphism**. This application demonstrates the power of TypeScript in managing multiple classes and interactions in a clean and maintainable way.

## Features

- **Add** new tasks to your to-do list.
- **Mark tasks as completed** or delete them.
- **Edit** existing tasks.
- **View tasks** in a dynamic list format.
- **User interaction** with multiple classes and OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better code structure.
- **CSS**: Styling of the application interface.
- **HTML**: Basic structure of the app.
- **JavaScript**: For handling app logic and interaction.
- **EJS**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic content.

## OOP Principles Implemented

- **Inheritance**: Common task features are inherited by specific task types (e.g., general tasks, priority tasks).
- **Polymorphism**: The app uses polymorphism to handle different types of tasks dynamically based on their properties.
